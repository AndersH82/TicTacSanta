# Tic Tac Santa 
Tic-tac-toe (America English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os (Canadian or Irish English) is a paper and pancile game for 2 players who take turns marking the squares in a three by three grid with X or O. The player who succeds in plasing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
