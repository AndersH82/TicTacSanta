# Tic Tac Santa 
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os (Canadian or Irish English) is a paper and pencil game for 2 players who take turns marking the squares in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming the best play from both players.

### Unfixed Bugs

There is a bug that I found out a little too late to catch before submitting. This does not affect gameplay.
If you click in the same cell, it stores the player's images and then creates a cheat.
